Zone Firewall Binding Guide (VyOS) — simple version
1) What a “binding” means

This VyOS line:

set firewall zone <TO> from <FROM> firewall name <RULESET>

Means:

Traffic coming FROM <FROM> and going TO <TO> uses <RULESET>.

So think of it like:

FROM → TO

(But the command looks like TO <- FROM.)

2) The easy way to pick zones

Ask yourself two questions:

Where is the traffic going? → that’s the TO zone

Where is it coming from? → that’s the FROM zone

Your script asking in this order is correct:
TO zone → FROM zone → RULESET

3) Examples
Example A: ADMINS → WAN

FROM = ADMINS

TO = WAN

Ruleset name should be: ADMINS-to-WAN

Command becomes:

set firewall zone WAN from ADMINS firewall name ADMINS-to-WAN
Example B: WAN → ADMINS

FROM = WAN

TO = ADMINS

Ruleset name should be: WAN-to-ADMINS

Command becomes:

set firewall zone ADMINS from WAN firewall name WAN-to-ADMINS
4) Why it feels confusing

Your ruleset names look like:

FROM-to-TO (example: ADMINS-to-WAN)

But the VyOS binding command is written like:

TO … from FROM (looks reversed)

They mean the same direction, just written differently.

5) Quick trick so you don’t get mixed up

When using the script, imagine:

FROM → TO

Then remember the command will look like:

TO <- FROM

Ruleset name should match the direction:

FROM-to-TO
